# HackatonBoe
webScrapping of the Boe to obtain as a result all the articles that talk about a specific topic in a given period of time. Both lexical and semantic searches are possible.

You must have the boe.ttl file in the same file directory where you run the notebook as it is the base ontology from which the RDF is then generated (if u want to add the articles to GraphDB to make queries).
